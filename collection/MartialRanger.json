It can use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can instead sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the drake to use an Attack, Dash, Disengage or Help action. If you are incapacitated, the drake can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.",

If the drake has died within the last hour, you can spend 10 minutes using a *healing poultice* to revive it with half the hit points normally provided by the *healing poultice*. You cannot revive the drake again in this way until you and your companion have completed a long rest.",
